# Bookmarks web app

This is a basic web application. The objective is to play with this to learn more about ASP.NET Core. I have been following the tutorial about [Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-6.0) from the ASP.NET Core documentation.

Another great resource is this episode of [Let's Learn .NET](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVGRpRwbMhUA0KAvMA2mLyN): [Razor Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XWgEHcTe4k&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVGRpRwbMhUA0KAvMA2mLyN&index=10).
